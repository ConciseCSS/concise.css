A lot of inspiration for Concise came from [Harry Roberts'](http://csswizardry.com/) own front-end framework, [inuitcss](https://github.com/csswizardry/inuit.css). We thank him for his sensible approach to crafting modular and customizable front-end frameworks, and for guidelines on [writing and maitaining beautiful CSS](https://github.com/csswizardry/CSS-Guidelines). You will see comments throughout the code in Concise where we've either borrowed inspiration or code from his framework.
